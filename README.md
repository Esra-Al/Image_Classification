# Fashion Image Classification and Captioning

This project aims to create an innovative solution for fashion image classification and captioning, utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and OpenAI's powerful APIs. Our project is divided into several key components, each tackling a specific aspect of the challenge.

## Components

### A. Fashion Image Scraper

- **Description**: This component is responsible for sourcing fashion images from ThreadUp. It automates the process of gathering a diverse set of fashion images to be used for training and testing our models.

### B. Image Captioning with OpenAI

- **Description**: We leverage OpenAI's capabilities to generate accurate and descriptive captions for the sourced fashion images. This step is crucial for creating a labeled dataset that will be used for further model training and validation.

### C. Embed Database Captions

- **Description**: Utilizing OpenAI's embedding capabilities, we transform the image captions into vector representations. These embeddings allow us to perform efficient similarity comparisons, which is essential for the next steps of the project.

### D. Search Images

- **Description**: This component uses OpenAI to embed search queries and performs a cosine similarity comparison with our database of image captions. It enables us to find and return the top 'x' images that are most relevant to the user's query.

### E. GUI for Search Execution

- **Status**: Work in Progress  
- **Description**: We are currently developing a user-friendly graphical interface that will allow users to easily execute searches and view the results. This component aims to make our solution accessible to a broader audience, regardless of their technical background.

## Other Files

- **zB - Custom Image Captioner**: In addition to using OpenAI for image captioning, we are developing our own fine-tuned Language Learning Model (LLM) for this task. This model is being trained with the captions generated by OpenAI, aiming to create a specialized solution for fashion image captioning.
